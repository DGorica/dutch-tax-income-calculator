			<p>Once I came to conclusion that salary calculations took much time. I'd tried to find online tool but fould
				only spreadsheet that did not work for me.</p>
			<p>Being AngularJS lover I decided to spend several hours and create such tool based on this framework. You can
				see code on <a href="https://github.com/stevermeister/dutch-tax-income-calculator">github</a>, welcome for
				propositions.
